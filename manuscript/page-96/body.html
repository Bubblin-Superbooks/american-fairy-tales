Indeed, two men fired several shots at us this morning, but the bullets only ruffled our feathers and buried themselves in our stuffing. We do not fear men now."</p><p>"Listen!" said Popopo, sternly, for he felt the birds were getting the best of the argument; "the poor milliner's business will be ruined if I do not return you to her shop.

So the poor milliner's wares, although beautified by lace and ribbons, are worthless unless you are perched upon them."</p><p>"Fashions," said a black bird, solemnly, "are made by men.
