Now, make haste and set me free—if you want the world to run properly."</p><p>"How did I happen to catch you?" asked Jim, without making a move to release his captive.</p><p>"I don't know.

That's why I was crossing this field, where I supposed no one would be. And I should have been perfectly safe had it not been for your beastly lasso. Now, then," he added, crossly, "are you going to get that rope off?"</p></div> </div>
